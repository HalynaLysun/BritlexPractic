🎯 Project Goals
The main objective of this project was to strengthen core front-end skills, specifically:

Semantic HTML: Building a structured document for better SEO and accessibility.

Layout Mastery: Implementing clean and organized layouts using CSS Flexbox.

Pixel-Perfect Practice: Transforming a design mockup into a functional web page with precise styling.

Responsive Design: Ensuring the layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes.

📱 Responsive Features
The project is fully optimized for a smooth user experience on various devices:

Desktop Version: Optimized for large screens with a wide multi-column layout.

Tablet Version: Adjusted elements and spacing for medium-sized touch devices.

Mobile Version: A stacked, single-column layout designed for small screens and readability.

🛠️ Built With
HTML5 – Semantic markup (header, section, main, footer).

CSS3 – Custom properties (variables), Flexbox, and Media Queries for responsiveness.

GitHub Pages – For project hosting.

💡 Key Features
Simple & Clean: Pure code written entirely in plain HTML and CSS without any third-party libraries or frameworks.

Smooth Navigation: Integrated scroll-behavior: smooth for elegant transitions between sections via anchor links.

[!NOTE]

Project Status: This is a static frontend-only practice project. Buttons and forms are currently non-functional, and there is no JavaScript/Backend logic implemented (e.g., the mobile menu toggle is visual), as the primary focus was on layout and styling.
